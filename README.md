## What's this about

This is a syntax highlighting package for [user21820](https://math.stackexchange.com/users/21820)'s [rules](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1684204/888233) for natural deduction.

## Usage

Just follow the syntax from their system. To show the rule used, enclose it with brackets, like `[â‡’sub]`.

## Contribution

If you want to contribute, just do a PR. I can't maintain everything that will be added to the system, for instance, definitorial expansions. But please make sure it follows user21820's system. I, myself, try to follow it too.
